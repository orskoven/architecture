### Micro Frontend Architecture Plan for Fortune 10 Companies

Micro frontends bring modularization to frontend applications, much like microservices for backend systems. A Fortune 10 company demands scalability, high performance, and robustness, making it crucial to focus on a federated architecture, cross-team ownership, and seamless integration.

Hereâ€™s a detailed plan to implement a micro frontend architecture:

---

### **1. Architecture Overview**

#### **Goals:**
1. Decouple frontend modules for independent development and deployment.
2. Enable technology-agnostic frontends (React, Angular, Vue, etc.).
3. Ensure seamless user experience (no full page reloads).
4. Scalable infrastructure with robust CI/CD pipelines.

#### **Proposed Approach:**
- **Module Federation (Webpack 5):** Use to share code/modules dynamically across apps.
- **Single SPA (or an equivalent orchestrator):** Manages multiple frontend apps.
- **API Gateway:** Ensures APIs are abstracted and frontends access only required data.
- **Shared Design System:** Ensures consistent UI/UX across applications.

---

### **2. Steps to Implement**

#### **Step 1: Define Domains**
1. Break the application into logical domains, e.g., **Search**, **Cart**, **Product Details**, and **Profile**.
2. Each domain becomes an independently deployable micro frontend.

#### **Step 2: Setup Module Federation**
Use Webpack 5 Module Federation for sharing components, utilities, or libraries.

#### **Step 3: Orchestrate with Single SPA**
Integrate individual micro frontends with Single SPA for smooth routing and lifecycle management.

#### **Step 4: Shared Design System**
Host the design system in a shared library using Module Federation or as a CDN-served library.

#### **Step 5: CI/CD Pipelines**
Automate deployment pipelines for each micro frontend using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Azure DevOps.

---

### **3. Example Code**

#### **Step 3.1: Host App (Shell)**
Manages routing and integrates individual micro frontends.

**`webpack.config.js` for Shell App:**
```javascript
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require('webpack').container.ModuleFederationPlugin;

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  devServer: {
    port: 3000,
  },
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'shell',
      remotes: {
        cart: 'cart@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js',
        profile: 'profile@http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js',
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

**Routing in Shell App:**
```javascript
import { registerApplication, start } from 'single-spa';

registerApplication({
  name: '@company/cart',
  app: () => System.import('cart'),
  activeWhen: ['/cart'],
});

registerApplication({
  name: '@company/profile',
  app: () => System.import('profile'),
  activeWhen: ['/profile'],
});

start();
```

---

#### **Step 3.2: Micro Frontend - Cart**
Standalone app that integrates into the shell.

**`webpack.config.js` for Cart App:**
```javascript
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require('webpack').container.ModuleFederationPlugin;

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  devServer: {
    port: 3001,
  },
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'cart',
      filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
      exposes: {
        './CartApp': './src/CartApp',
      },
      shared: ['react', 'react-dom'],
    }),
  ],
};
```

**Cart App:**
```javascript
import React from 'react';

const CartApp = () => <h1>Welcome to the Cart</h1>;

export default CartApp;
```

---

#### **Step 3.3: Shared Design System**
Use a shared library for consistent UI components.

**`webpack.config.js`:**
```javascript
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require('webpack').container.ModuleFederationPlugin;

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  devServer: {
    port: 3003,
  },
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'design_system',
      filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
      exposes: {
        './Button': './src/components/Button',
      },
      shared: ['react'],
    }),
  ],
};
```

**Button Component in Design System:**
```javascript
import React from 'react';

const Button = ({ label, onClick }) => (
  <button onClick={onClick} style={{ padding: '10px', fontSize: '16px' }}>
    {label}
  </button>
);

export default Button;
```

---

### **4. Deployment Plan**

#### **CI/CD Workflow**
1. **Trigger:** Push to GitHub or GitLab.
2. **Build:** Lint, test, and bundle micro frontend.
3. **Deploy:** Publish to CDN or cloud services (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
4. **Notify:** Update the orchestrator with the new version.

#### Example CI/CD YAML (GitHub Actions):
```yaml
name: Deploy Cart Micro Frontend

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
    - name: Deploy to S3
      env:
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
      run: aws s3 sync ./dist s3://my-cart-app
```

---

### **5. Monitoring and Logging**
Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Datadog, Splunk) and logging frameworks to ensure observability across micro frontends.

---

### **6. Conclusion**
This architecture enables scalability, independent deployment, and robust team collaboration. It aligns well with Fortune 10 companies' needs, ensuring seamless user experience and rapid iteration.
